      PHOTOGRAPHY
      <h3>
        Photography has been used throughout history and into the present day as
        a tool for science and exploration; as a means of documenting people,
        places and events; of telling stories and recording histories; and as a
        mode of communication and critique in our increasingly visual culture.
        Photography is important because it allows people to see the world from
        different points of view and to admire the most different scenarios and
        situations captured in a frozen moment.
