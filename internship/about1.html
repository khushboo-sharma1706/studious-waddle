      MEME MAKING
      <h3>
        A meme is quite simply a concept, behavior, or idea that spreads,
        usually via the internet. Memes most commonly manifest themselves in a
        visual such as a picture or a video, but it can also take the form of a
        link, hashtag, or even an entire website.
